This is repository of HOT Indonesia for provided some guidances for OSM Data Validation. In this repository, there are 3 main files:

1. **OSM Indonesia Presets**

   This is the official presets for OSM Mapping in Indonesia. This presets made based on 4 years HOT Indonesia mapping training experience in Indonesia. We compile all important objects and information that often need to be mapped while doing mapping in Indonesia. With this presets, we hope the quality of information and attributes objects in Indonesia can be improved so OSM data in Indonesia can be more reliable to use.

2. **Tracing Guide**

   This is OSM Wikipedia page which show list of object type and object description in Indonesia. It also shows its OSM key and values. This can be used as a guide for OSM users in Indonesia when they want to add or edit their objects and as improve its quality. In this repository its name is **'referensi-atribut-indonesia'** and provided in PDF and XML format. For online version for this tracing guide please look at [Referensi Atribut Objek OSM Indonesia (Indonesian Language)](http://www.wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Id:Referensi_Atribut_Objek_OSM_Indonesia)

3. **Field Survey Guide**

   This is guide for OSM user to doing field survey for mapping in OSM. In this guide, you will learn about how to using some field survey tool such as GPS, Field Papers and Geo Data Collect. Then, you will know what objects that should be mapped into OSM and what kind information you need to collect for each object. We believe that a good field survey will bring you good quality of data.
